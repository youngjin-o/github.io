# Jekyll on Replit

This is a styled Jekyll template to get you started with Jekyll static site generator on Replit. It's ready to go so you can just hit run and start coding!

The template uses the regular method of adding themes instead of gem-based themes. If you prefer using the gem-based themes use [Jekyll gem-based template](https://replit.com/@AvicNdugu/Jekyll-Using-Gem-base-Theme) instead. For those who want a barebone Jekyll theme without any styling, use [Barebone Jekyll template](https://replit.com/@AvicNdugu/Jekyll).

## Running the repl

Simply hit run!

## Installing Additional packages

To add packages to your Jekyll repl, we recommend using the Replit packager interface in the left sidebar or using `bundle install` in the shell. Check out the [Bundle docs here](https://bundler.io/v2.3/#getting-started).

To add a regular theme, find the desired theme on jekyll themes website. Then add the necessary folders(_layouts, _data, and _include) and files in the main home directory from the theme. Add your posts in the _posts directory.
